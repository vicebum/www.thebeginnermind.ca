              <p class="section2">Following the voice prompts, you will be guided through a quick meditation practice to help you get into the mindful swing of things. This practice is taken from a combination of several beginner's meditation guides and is designed to introduce you to the basics. Try to go about this practice with a fresh mindset, be curious, and open to what arises.</p>

              <p class="show">Find yourself in a seated comfortable position and bring your attention to the breath. Whenever your thoughts drift away, calmly bring your attention back to the breath as this will likely happen often. Try not to overthink the moment. Clearing the mind is not an easy task.</p>

            <p class="show">Start to notice your body...how does it feel? Can you pay close attention to the way your clothes feel against your skin and how your seat feels supported beneath you. Sink into this posture. It's almost like you are attempting to grow roots into the earth, reaching up tall with the upper portion of your body.</p>

              <p class="show">Start becoming aware of the details of your sensory experience. Notice the layers of the sounds around you. Perhaps you can hear sounds outside of the room; cars on the street, birds chirping, the hum of the refrigerator. Without thinking about their source, simply notice the sounds as they are. Try not to get too fixated on what's causing them... and just let them be.</p>

              <p class="show">Slowly see if you can go deeper into sensing your physical body. Maybe you're noticing the discomfort in the joints, the sensatation of impatience, cramps in the muscles, or a headache. It is easy become fixated on the negativety of the body's sensations. Try to stay with any grievences of this moment, and with acceptance let them go.</p>

        <p class="section2">How did that go? You might find that spending even 3 minutes practicing just with your breath, that there is a stillness or feeling of expansion in the body. If this was not the case donâ€™t beat yourself up! The whole object of practice is that it takes time and repetition.</p>
            <p class="section2">You can also bring this awareness of the breath into your life through other activities. The basics stay the same, no matter where you are or what you're doing. You can think of this exercise as part of your mindfulness toolkit.</p>
